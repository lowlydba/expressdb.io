# Everything you need to get the most out of SQL Server Express
After years of working as a database administrator, there is a small area of the SQL Server world that never seems to receive enough attention, despite its prevalence and very affordable price tag of free: SQL Server Express. As the database of choice for many software vendors who need a powerful, but modestly sized, database backend for their application, the free edition of SQL Server offers amazing technology, ahead of its open source counterparts in many areas, without the need to spend money on licensing.

However, there are a few noticeable differences that separate SQL Server Express from its other SQL Server siblings. This site is for those who need to make the most out of their SQL Express installation, for those who want to eek out every bit of performance and automation they can, all while still playing within the boundaries and limitations of SQL Server Express.
