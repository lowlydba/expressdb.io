# Everything you need to get the most out of SQL Server Express

:wave: Hi, I'm [John McCall](/about.html), aka LowlyDBA.

While almost every conceivable topic on SQL Server has been and continues
to be covered in great detail
by MVPs and diligent bloggers,
a dedicated resource that addresses the many quirks of SQL Server Express has
never existed. There
were fragments of issues and questions scattered around message boards and
forums that cover the unique challenges
and limitations of SQL Server Express, but until now
there hasn't been a single place to find most of that information.

I have been able to learn so much from the SQL Server community members who consistently
provide free advice, resources, and tools to other data professionals.
This site is my opportunity to create something free and useful for the
community as a thank you.

My hope is that this site is useful for anyone using, learning, or weighing
options about
SQL Server Express. It is a fascinating and powerful free database engine that
has earned
a place of common usage for many software vendors and students alike.

\- John
