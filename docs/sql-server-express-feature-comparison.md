# SQL Server Edition Feature Comparison

The most well known differences between SQL Express and other editions are the
[caps on database size](/sql-server-express-database-size-limit.html) (10GB) and [lack of a SQL Agent feature](/sql-server-express-replace-sql-agent.html). There are many other
differences though, some of which can be extremely important for some application
and architecture requirements.

Due to the rarity of SQL Server Business Intelligence, SQL Server
Web Edition, SQL Server Datacenter, and other versions, they will not be included in the below comparisons.

The features included below are selected base on overall popularity and value,
and do not represent every feature of SQL Server nor all of the parity between editions.

## Windows Edition Features

* [2014](#sql-server-windows-2014)
* [2012](#sql-server-windows-2012)
* [2008 R2](#sql-server-windows-2008-r2)

## Linux Features

Some features of SQL Server, regardless of edition, are unsupported in Linux.

* [Linux 2022](#sql-server-linux-2022)
* [Linux 2019](#sql-server-linux-2019)
* [Linux 2017](#sql-server-linux-2017)

## FAQ

**What is the difference between Basic Auditing and Fine Grained Auditing?**

These terms are only used in Microsoft feature comparison documents, but not SQL Server documentation, so their use is often unclear to many. Basic auditing refers to [server level audits](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/create-server-audit-transact-sql?view=sql-server-2017) while fine grained auditing refers to [audits at the database level](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/create-database-audit-specification-transact-sql?view=sql-server-2017).
